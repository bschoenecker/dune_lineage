She was the early lover of Xavier Harkonnen and was captured by the machines during the defense of Zimia. Unbeknownst to her, she was pregnant at the time of her capture with Xavier's son Manion (junior). Serena became the personal study of the machine Erasmus and gave birth to baby Manion while in the machines custody. Erasmus became jealous of the time Serena was devoting to Manion and so was murdered by Erasmus in front of throngs of human slaves. This spawned the fervor that instigated the Butlerian Jihad. Her personal tragedy—the death of her infant son at the hands of the machines—sparked widespread outrage and united humanity in the fight. Revered as a martyr and symbol of resistance, Serena's leadership and sacrifice help lay the foundation for the eventual rise of the Imperium and the anti-technology ethos of the Dune universe.",
