After reading Frank's Dune books twice and starting on the full 23 book canon, I realized how rich the 10,000+ year history of the Dune expanded universe is. I wanted to find a good tool where I could explore that history and those relationships. I found some flowcharts and diagrams, but I wanted to create something a little more interactive. This diagram in GoJS attempts to create an easily browsable lineage tree of the major characters within the Dune universe. 

Features:
- Upstream and downstream ancestor relationships
- Male / Female designations
- Expanded context and information on each character
- A reference to which books the character appears in
- Conception relationships
- Relationships that highlight and are easily visible when a character is selected

This diagram is being devloped using GoJS, a powerful Javascript-based platform for creating interactive diagrams. You can find more information about it here: https://gojs.net/latest/index.html
